title: "GenAI for Teaching and Research"
---

## Welcome

This website is designed to provide an introduction to Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, with a focus on practical understanding and effective utilization of these tools for teaching and research. The goal of the website is to provide a repository of resources that academics can use to:

1. **Understand** the fundamental concepts behind generative AI and large language models
2. **Navigate** the current landscape of GenAI tools and platforms
3. **Identify** key capabilities and limitations of different GenAI systems
4. **Select** appropriate tools for various use cases
5. **Apply** best practices for effective GenAI utilization

## Safety and privacy 

Before we talk about capabilities, we need shared norms. Some of the biggest risks of GenAI in education and research are **misplaced trust** and **unsafe data handling**.

- **Don’t upload sensitive data** into consumer tools unless your institution has an approved, protected environment ("Enterprise" level subscriptions usually offer this).
  - Examples of sensitive data: identifiable student info (FERPA), unpublished manuscripts, reviewer comments, proprietary datasets, IRB-protected data, confidential employer partner data.
- Tools like **agentic browsers** and **conding agents** may automatically parse the environment you give them access to (e.g. an open browser window, or a folder on your computer). It is your responsibility to ensure that these environments do not contain sensitive data.
