    "section": "How Agentic Workflows Address Model Shortcomings",
    "text": "How Agentic Workflows Address Model Shortcomings\nLLMs on their own have fundamental limitations: they only know what was in their training data, they can confidently generate false information, they can’t remember past conversations, and they can’t take actions in the world. Agentic workflows—combining thinking, tool use, and orchestration—go a long way towards addressing these limitations.\n\nKnowledge cutoff\nLLMs are trained on data up to a certain date. They don’t know about recent events, updated policies, or new research.\nWeb search tools allow models to retrieve current information in real-time. When you ask ChatGPT about today’s news, it searches the web and incorporates fresh results into its response. This is called grounding—anchoring the model’s output in factual, up-to-date sources.\n\n\nLong-term memory\nThe context window is the model’s only “memory”—once a conversation exceeds it, earlier content is forgotten. Models also can’t remember anything from previous sessions.\nExternal memory systems give models persistent storage:\n\nConversation memory: Systems can store summaries or key facts from past sessions and inject them into future conversations\nStructured databases: Tools can query SQL databases, spreadsheets, or CRMs to retrieve specific records\nVector databases and RAG: For unstructured knowledge (documents, policies, research papers), we use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is RAG?\n\n\n\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that lets models answer questions using your own documents:\n\nIndexing: Documents are split into chunks and converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning. These are stored in a vector database.\nRetrieval: When you ask a question, your query is also converted to a vector. The system finds document chunks with similar vectors (i.e., related content).\nGeneration: The retrieved chunks are inserted into the prompt as context, and the model generates an answer grounded in your documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nHallucinations\nModels sometimes generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. This happens because LLMs are pattern-completion machines—they predict likely text, not truthful text.\nSolutions:\n\nWeb search grounding: You can ask models to cite sources, so you can verify claims. Many systems now include inline citations.\nRAG with citations: Answers grounded in retrieved documents can point to specific sources, making verification easy.\nCode execution: For math and logic, models can write and run code rather than “reasoning” their way to an answer.\nVerification loops: Agentic systems can include explicit fact-checking steps where the model (or a separate model) reviews output for consistency and flags uncertain claims.\n\n\n\nAbility to act\nLLMs can only generate text. To actually do things—send emails, update databases, control software—they need to interact with external systems.\nSolutions:\n\nAPIs (Application Programming Interfaces): APIs are standardized ways for software systems to communicate. A model might request a call to a calendar API to schedule meetings, a Slack API to post messages, or a payment API to process transactions. The model generates the appropriate API call, the system executes it, and results flow back.\nMCP (Model Context Protocol): MCP is an emerging open standard (developed by Anthropic) that provides a uniform way to connect AI models to external tools and data sources. Instead of building custom integrations for each tool, developers can create MCP “servers” that any MCP-compatible model can use.\nBrowser automation: Agentic browsers (like OpenAI Atlas or Perplexity Comet) let models navigate websites, fill forms, click buttons, and extract information—essentially using the web like a human would."

Each model has its own vocabulary of tokens.\nContext assembly: Your prompt is combined with any previous messages in the conversation, plus a “system prompt” (instructions the model provider includes automatically).\n\nContext Window: The model sees all tokens in the context at once (no memory between subsequent prompts). Window size limits how much text fits in a single interaction. Larger windows = more capability but higher cost.\n\nForward pass: The tokenized input goes through the model’s neural network. Each layer does mathematical operations—essentially matrix multiplications—transforming the input through the billions of parameters.\nOutput generation: The model produces a probability distribution over all possible next tokens in its vocabulary. It samples from this distribution (with some randomness controlled by “temperature”), adds that token to the sequence, and repeats until it ends up sampling a “stop” token.\n\nTemperature: Controls randomness in selection:\n\nTemperature = 0: Always pick the highest-probability token (deterministic)\nTemperature = 1: Sample proportionally to probabilities\n\nTemperature &gt; 1: Flatten the distribution (more random/creative)\n\n\nDetokenization: Once a “stop” token is reached, the output tokens are converted back to human-readable text.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Input\n        A[\"User Prompt\"]\n        S[\"System Prompt\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Tokenization\n        B[\"Tokenizer\"]\n        C[\"Token IDs\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Processing\n        D[\"Context Window\"]\n        E[\"LLM\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Output\n        F{\"Probability\\nDistribution\"}\n        G[\"Temperature\"]\n        H[\"Selected Token\"]\n    end\n    \n    A --&gt; B\n    S --&gt; B\n    B --&gt; C --&gt; D --&gt; E --&gt; F --&gt; G --&gt; H\n    H --&gt;|\"Append & repeat\"| D\n    linkStyle 8 stroke-dasharray: 5 5"

But this is bolted-on storage, not true learning—the model’s parameters don’t change based on your interactions.\n\n\nHallucinations\nLLMs can generate confident, fluent text that is factually incorrect. Models don’t “know” things. They are optimized for producing probable sounding text, not verified truth. This means they can:\n\nInvent citations that don’t exist\nState incorrect facts with complete confidence\nMix accurate and inaccurate information seamlessly\n\n\n\nInability to act\nGenAI models ingest tokens and output tokens. The can not exert change on external systems (“act”). They cannot send emails, execute code, query databases, browse the web, modify files. The model can describe how to do these things, but it cannot actually perform them without external systems.\nThis is where agents come in: By connecting LLMs to tools (APIs, code interpreters, file systems), we can create systems that can take real-world actions. The Agents section describes how modern frameworks address these limitations by giving models the ability to plan, use tools, and affect external systems."

    "text": "Curricular Recommendations\n\n1. More Experiential Learning\nThe core challenge: how do we make a 22-year-old graduate look like an experienced 27-year-old to employers, given that AI can now handle much of what entry-level workers used to do?\nStudents need repeated opportunities to:\n\nDefine problems (not just solve pre-defined ones)\nHypothesize potential solutions\nEvaluate and choose among alternatives\nCommunicate solutions and interpret feedback\nIntegrate multiple sources into a coherent “product”\n\n\n\n2. Generating New Knowledge/New Value\nPablo Picasso: “Computers are useless. They only give you answers.”\nUniversities spend too little time getting students to ask their own questions and defend their solutions. GenAI might actually accelerate the process of moving students toward the knowledge frontier, enabling more ambitious independent work.\n\n\n3. Evaluating Source Validity\nGenAI puts information literacy problems “on steroids” for three reasons:\n\nThe predictive process for generating text obscures underlying sources\nWhen prompted for sources, GenAI mixes authoritative and non-authoritative citations\nOften there is no real “source”—the output is a statistical amalgamation or outright fabrication\n\nStudents need to become “source detectives.”\n\n\n4. Epistemology: What Counts as Evidence?\nEach discipline has its own standards of evidence. Universities need to be much more explicit about teaching students how we know what we know—how questions are defined, how answers are arrived at, how claims are evaluated. Most students, if asked, would struggle to articulate this process.\n\n\n5. Show Students the Path from Day One\nStudents will ask: “Just let us use the AI tools already!” But using GenAI effectively without foundational knowledge is like getting into a cockpit for your first solo flight without ground training.\nUniversities must help students see from the start why building a worldview, understanding a discipline, and being information-literate are prerequisites for realizing GenAI’s potential."

    "section": "Implementation Challenges",
    "text": "Implementation Challenges\n\n1. Creating AI-Proof Assessments\nThis is a moving target. Last fall, asking students to draw graphs was a workaround; now GenAI handles graphs well. The deeper question: what experiences and assessments build learning under the assumption that students will always have these tools?\n\n\n2. Experiential Learning is Expensive\n500 students in a lecture hall with computer-graded exams is cheap. Experiential learning is not. Active learning approaches and Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) offer scalable alternatives.\n\n\n3. Student Readiness\nMany students are accustomed to regurgitating information, not open-ended inquiry. Honors students may thrive; helping the broader student body adapt will require careful planning and support.\n\n\n4. Centralized vs. Decentralized AI Policies\nThe authors disagree here:\n\nAkridge (Provost perspective): Universities need some campus-wide AI guidance—basic skills, ethical use, clear expectations—while preserving local latitude.\nHummels (Dean perspective): Course-level policies are sufficient. Students adapt to different rules in different contexts all the time. “Just read the damn syllabus!”\n\n\n\n5. Supporting Faculty\nWith GenAI still early in adoption, universities should encourage experimentation, extract lessons, and then systematically scale what works—using stage-gate innovation models borrowed from industry.\n\n\n6. Staying Current with Employers\nUniversities can’t wait for a steady state. They need ongoing engagement with employers to understand how AI is changing what firms want from entry-level hires.\n\n\n7. Cost and Access to AI Tools\nFree access to powerful AI tools may not last. Developers are hemorrhaging money; monetization is coming. The result could be a two-tier system: some students on “low-rent chatbots,” others on “gold-plated premium bots”—unless universities absorb the cost.\n\n\n8. AI and Student Mental Health\nSome users show evidence of AI-related psychoses and suicidal ideation. Once universities actively encourage AI use, student mental health implications need to be on the radar."

Unfortunately, many university assignments fall squarely in these categories.\nMost jobs are bundles of tasks. Even where AI can replace specific tasks, integrating those into workflows takes time. Workers who can solve well-defined problems and integrate solutions into larger contexts will be valuable.\nThe real value isn’t cost reduction—it’s creating new opportunities. The question for employers shifts from “which workers can I lay off?” to “what new value can these workers create with AI?” Universities should prepare students to answer that second question."

    "text": "Curricular Recommendations\n\n1. More Experiential Learning\nThe core challenge: how do we make a 22-year-old graduate look like an experienced 27-year-old to employers, given that AI can now handle much of what entry-level workers used to do?\nStudents need repeated opportunities to:\n\nDefine problems (not just solve pre-defined ones)\nHypothesize potential solutions\nEvaluate and choose among alternatives\nCommunicate solutions and interpret feedback\nIntegrate multiple sources into a coherent “product”\n\n\n\n2. Generating New Knowledge/New Value\nPablo Picasso: “Computers are useless. They only give you answers.”\nUniversities spend too little time getting students to ask their own questions and defend their solutions. GenAI might actually accelerate the process of moving students toward the knowledge frontier, enabling more ambitious independent work.\n\n\n3. Evaluating Source Validity\nGenAI puts information literacy problems “on steroids” for three reasons:\n\nThe predictive process for generating text obscures underlying sources\nWhen prompted for sources, GenAI mixes authoritative and non-authoritative citations\nOften there is no real “source”—the output is a statistical amalgamation or outright fabrication\n\nStudents need to become “source detectives.”\n\n\n4. Epistemology: What Counts as Evidence?\nEach discipline has its own standards of evidence. Universities need to be much more explicit about teaching students how we know what we know—how questions are defined, how answers are arrived at, how claims are evaluated. Most students, if asked, would struggle to articulate this process.\n\n\n5. Show Students the Path from Day One\nStudents will ask: “Just let us use the AI tools already!” But using GenAI effectively without foundational knowledge is like getting into a cockpit for your first solo flight without ground training.\nUniversities must help students see from the start why building a worldview, understanding a discipline, and being information-literate are prerequisites for realizing GenAI’s potential."

    "text": "Implementation Challenges\n\n1. Creating AI-Proof Assessments\nThis is a moving target. Last fall, asking students to draw graphs was a workaround; now GenAI handles graphs well. The deeper question: what experiences and assessments build learning under the assumption that students will always have these tools?\n\n\n2. Experiential Learning is Expensive\n500 students in a lecture hall with computer-graded exams is cheap. Experiential learning is not. Active learning approaches and Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) offer scalable alternatives.\n\n\n3. Student Readiness\nMany students are accustomed to regurgitating information, not open-ended inquiry. Honors students may thrive; helping the broader student body adapt will require careful planning and support.\n\n\n4. Centralized vs. Decentralized AI Policies\nThe authors disagree here:\n\nAkridge (Provost perspective): Universities need some campus-wide AI guidance—basic skills, ethical use, clear expectations—while preserving local latitude.\nHummels (Dean perspective): Course-level policies are sufficient. Students adapt to different rules in different contexts all the time. “Just read the damn syllabus!”\n\n\n\n5. Supporting Faculty\nWith GenAI still early in adoption, universities should encourage experimentation, extract lessons, and then systematically scale what works—using stage-gate innovation models borrowed from industry.\n\n\n6. Staying Current with Employers\nUniversities can’t wait for a steady state. They need ongoing engagement with employers to understand how AI is changing what firms want from entry-level hires.\n\n\n7. Cost and Access to AI Tools\nFree access to powerful AI tools may not last. Developers are hemorrhaging money; monetization is coming. The result could be a two-tier system: some students on “low-rent chatbots,” others on “gold-plated premium bots”—unless universities absorb the cost.\n\n\n8. AI and Student Mental Health\nSome users show evidence of AI-related psychoses and suicidal ideation. Once universities actively encourage AI use, student mental health implications need to be on the radar."

These parameters encode patterns learned from reading enormous amounts of text.\nThat is what the model “knows”—statistical patterns about how language works and what tends to follow what.\n\nHow the Numbers Are Obtained\nThe training process happens in stages:\nPre-training: The model reads massive amounts of text from the internet, books, code repositories, academic papers—essentially a substantial portion of human written output. During this phase, it learns to predict “what word comes next?” billions of times. The parameters adjust to get better at prediction. This takes months and costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in compute.\nPost-training (Fine-tuning): The base model is then adjusted using:\n\nSupervised fine-tuning (SFT): Humans write example conversations showing how the model should respond\nReinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): Humans rate model outputs, and the model learns to generate outputs that get higher ratings\nConstitutional AI (CAI): Used by Anthropic, where the model learns to critique and revise its own outputs based on principles\n\nContinuous refinement: Models are updated regularly to improve performance, fix issues, and add capabilities.\nKey terms you might hear: “transformer architecture” (the mathematical structure these models use), “attention mechanism” (how the model decides what parts of the input to focus on), “parameters” or “weights” (the numbers in the file)."

    "text": "“Thinking” (Planning) Models and Tool Use\n\nThinking Models\nStandard LLMs generate output token-by-token in a single pass—they don’t “stop and think.” Thinking models (like OpenAI’s o1/o3, Claude with extended thinking, or DeepSeek R1) add an explicit reasoning phase before producing their final answer.\nHow it works:\n\nThe model receives your prompt\nBefore answering, it generates a chain of thought—a series of reasoning steps that break down the problem\n\nIn modern systems, this thinking is visible to you and it’s a good idea to inspect it and see if you can spot issues with it\nFor some producs like ChatGPT Pro Deep Research, you can pause the thinking/execution loop if you want to correct some reasoning errors or want to add more context\n\n\nThe model can reconsider, catch errors, and refine its approach during this phase\nOnly after thinking does it produce the final response\n\nTrade-offs: Thinking models are better at complex reasoning (math, logic, multi-step problems) but are slower and more expensive because they generate many more tokens internally.\n\n\nTool Use\nLLMs can only generate tokens—they can’t browse the web, run code, or access databases. “Tool use” (also called “function calling”) extends models to interact with external systems.\nHow it works:\n\nThe system prompt tells the model what tools are available (e.g., “You can search the web” or “You can run Python code”)\nInstead of generating text, the model can output a structured tool call (e.g., search(\"current weather in NYC\"), where search is a Python function somewhere on an OpenAI server)\nThe system executes the tool and returns the result to the model\nThe model incorporates the result into its context and continues generating\nThis loop can repeat—models can chain multiple tool calls to accomplish complex tasks\n\nWhy it matters: Tool use lets models access current information (web search), verify calculations (code execution), and take actions in the real world (APIs). It transforms LLMs from text generators into agents that can accomplish tasks.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    subgraph Input\n        A[\"User Prompt\"]\n        S[\"System Prompt\\n+ Available Tools\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Processing\n        D[\"Context Window\"]\n        E[\"LLM\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"LLM Output\"\n        F{\"Output\\nType?\"}\n        T[\"Thinking\\nTokens\"]\n        G[\"Tool Call\"]\n        H[\"Final\\nResponse\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Tools\n        X[\"Execute Tool\"]\n        R[\"Tool Result\"]\n    end\n    \n    A --&gt; D\n    S --&gt; D\n    D --&gt; E --&gt; F\n    F --&gt;|\"Reasoning\"| T\n    T --&gt;|\"Append\"| D\n    F --&gt;|\"Tool\"| G --&gt; X --&gt; R\n    R --&gt;|\"Append\"| D\n    F --&gt;|\"Done\"| H\n    linkStyle 5 stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n    linkStyle 9 stroke-dasharray: 5 5\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key difference from the basic pipeline (at the top of this page): thinking models generate reasoning tokens as output that gets appended to the context, creating a loop where the model “thinks out loud” before producing its final answer. Tool-enabled models can similarly pause, call external tools, and incorporate results before continuing."

This is somewhat of a misnomer these days since the latest iterations of these models can handle more than just language (text) as an input. They can also process audio, image, and video inputs.\n\n\n\nTools -&gt; capabilities around the model:\n\nWeb search\nCode execution\nDatabase queries\nConnectors to other software/platforms like file systems, email clients, browsers, IDEs, CRMs, messaging apps etc\n\nFacilitated through APIs (application programming interfaces), and MCP (model context protocol) servers\n\n\nProducts (interfaces):\n\nWeb, desktop, and mobile apps from model providers: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok\nCoding agents: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist, GitHub Copilot\nThird-party apps: Perplexity, Replit, Cursor\n\n\nMany of these products use agentic workflows (agents) in the background (workflows orchestrated by a model) - The model plans steps, uses tools, analyzes the output of those tools, and iterates until it produces the requested output\n\n\n\nImage generated with Nano Banana Pro"

    "text": "Why the “GenAI as a stack” framing matters\nIt reminds us that:\n\nJumps in capability are not just about better models, but better models + better tools + better agentic workflows.\nDifferent products may be better at different tasks (sometimes in a way that is not necessarily related to the models they use underneath)\n\nFor example, Claude (product) may be better than ChatGPT (product) at generating Excel sheets because of better integration with Microsoft Office (tool), not because Claude Opus 4.5 (model) is better than GPT 5.2 (model)\n\nYou should not be judging the current capabilities of “GenAI” based on your experiences with a single product (ChatGPT for most people)"
