## Overview

Modern generative AI systems offer a wide range of capabilities. Understanding what these systems can (and cannot) do is essential for effective utilization.

## Core Text Capabilities

### Generation & Composition

- **Writing assistance**: Drafts, emails, reports, creative writing
- **Summarization**: Condense long documents into key points
- **Translation**: Convert between languages with nuance
- **Reformatting**: Change tone, style, or structure

### Analysis & Understanding

- **Text analysis**: Extract themes, sentiment, key information
- **Question answering**: Respond to queries about provided content
- **Comparison**: Analyze similarities and differences
- **Classification**: Categorize content by topic, type, or criteria

### Reasoning & Problem-Solving

- **Logical reasoning**: Work through multi-step problems
- **Mathematical computation**: Solve equations, statistical analysis
- **Planning**: Break down complex tasks into steps
- **Evaluation**: Assess arguments, identify weaknesses

## Code Capabilities

::: {.callout-tip}
## Code Generation
Modern LLMs are remarkably capable code assistants, able to:

- Write code from natural language descriptions
- Explain existing code
- Debug and fix errors
- Translate between programming languages
- Write tests and documentation
:::

### Common Use Cases

| Task | Example |
|------|---------|
| Code generation | "Write a Python function to parse CSV files" |
| Debugging | "Why does this code throw a TypeError?" |
| Refactoring | "Improve this code's readability" |
| Documentation | "Add docstrings to these functions" |

## Multimodal Capabilities

Modern models increasingly work across modalities:

### Vision

- **Image analysis**: Describe, analyze, extract text from images
- **Document processing**: Read charts, tables, handwriting
- **Visual reasoning**: Answer questions about image content

### Audio (emerging)

- **Transcription**: Convert speech to text
- **Voice interaction**: Real-time conversation
- **Music understanding**: Analyze and describe audio

## What GenAI Does Well

✅ Pattern-based tasks with clear examples  
✅ Creative brainstorming and ideation  
✅ Drafting and iteration on content  
✅ Explanation and education  
✅ Code assistance and debugging  
✅ Summarization and synthesis  

## Current Limitations

::: {.callout-warning}
## Important Limitations
Be aware of these common limitations:

- **Hallucination**: Can generate plausible but false information
- **Knowledge cutoff**: Training data has a cutoff date
- **Math reliability**: Can make arithmetic errors
- **Citation accuracy**: Often fabricates sources
- **Consistency**: May give different answers to same question
:::

❌ Guaranteed factual accuracy  
❌ Real-time information (without tools)  
❌ Reliable mathematical computation  
❌ Genuine understanding or consciousness  
❌ Perfect memory across sessions  

## Maximizing Effectiveness

1. **Play to strengths**: Use GenAI for tasks it excels at
2. **Verify outputs**: Especially for factual claims
3. **Iterate**: Use conversation to refine outputs
4. **Provide context**: Better input yields better output
5. **Combine with tools**: Use retrieval, calculators, etc.
