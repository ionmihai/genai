## Framing: what I mean by “GenAI”

When people say "AI," or “GenAI,” they often mean “ChatGPT” or a similar chat interface. **It’s more useful to think of GenAI in layers:**

1. **Models** -> the “brains”: 
    - GPT‑5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 3.0 Pro, Grok 4.1, etc.       
        - These models are frequently referred to as **LLMs** (large language models). This is somewhat of a misnomer these days since the latest iterations of these models can handle more than just language (text) as an input. They can also process audio, image, and video inputs.  
2. **Tools** -> capabilities around the model: 
    - Web search 
    - Code execution 
    - Database queries
    - Connectors to other software/platforms like file systems, email clients, browsers, IDEs, CRMs, messaging apps etc
        - Facilitated through APIs (application programming interfaces), and MCP (model context protocol) servers 
3. **Products** (interfaces): 
    - Web, desktop, and mobile apps from model providers: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok
    - Coding agents: Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist, GitHub Copilot
    - Third-party apps: Perplexity, Replit, Cursor 

Many of these products use agentic workflows (**agents**) in the background (workflows orchestrated by a model)
    - The model plans steps, uses tools, analyzes the output of those tools, and iterates until it produces the requested output

## Why the "GenAI as a stack" framing matters

It reminds us that:

- Jumps in capability are not just about better models, but **better models + better tools + better agentic workflows**.
- Different products may be better at different tasks (sometimes in a way that is not necessarily related to the models they use underneath)
    - For example, Claude (product) may be better than ChatGPT (product) at generating Excel sheets because of better integration with Microsoft Office (tool), not because Claude Opus 4.5 (model) is better than GPT 5.2 (model)
- You should not be judging the current capabilities of "GenAI" based on your experiences with a single product (ChatGPT for most people)
