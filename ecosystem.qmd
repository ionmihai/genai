## Quick framing: what I mean by “GenAI”

When people say “GenAI,” they often mean “ChatGPT.” For faculty purposes, it’s more useful to think in layers:

1. **Models** (the “brains”): GPT‑5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, etc.  
2. **Tools** (capabilities around the model): web search, file analysis, data analysis (Python), image analysis, spreadsheet/slides generation, connectors to Drive/Notion, etc.
3. **Agents** (orchestrated workflows): the system plans steps, uses tools, and iterates until it produces an output.
4. **Products** (interfaces): ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, NotebookLM, Perplexity, etc.

**Why this matters:** most “wow moments” in 2025–2026 are not just bigger models, but **models + tools + agentic workflows**.
